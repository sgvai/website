Recent advancements in AI have changed the way we relate to technology. We increasingly speak to our computers, use computers to extract meaning from images and expect that our tools intelligently react to context. This is a rapidly evolving field with big implications.

Our group serves to connect fellow AI, ML and data science geeks in the Los Angeles Basin and specifically the San Gabriel Valley. Our members meet to share some of the projects they've been working on, share interesting developments in the industry and to meet others in the community. We cater to everyone from the curious to the professional.

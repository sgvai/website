# Getting Started

## Install Dependencies

Install Pelican and ghp-import
```bash
$ pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```
## Clone Site

Checkout source (read only)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sgvai/website.git sgvai_website
```

If you are added to access list you can clone this way:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:sgvai/website.git sgvai_website
```

You must then init and update the submodules, which include the site's theme.
```bash
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
```


## Building the site

```bash
    make html                        # (re)generate the web site
    make clean                       # remove the generated files
    make regenerate                  # regenerate files upon modification
    make publish                     # generate using production settings
    make serve                       # serve site at http://localhost:8000
    make devserver                   # start/restart develop_server.sh
    make stopserver                  # stop local server
    make github                      # upload the web site via gh-pages
```

# NOTES:

Using Pelican 3.6.x because 3.7.1 caused theme sidebar to stop rendering.
